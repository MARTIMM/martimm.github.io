# Gtk 4 Module Reference

There are quite a lot of modules available now in this distribution. There are some which I believe are not needed and might be removed from this distribution later. There are also modules in Gtk which aren't yet generated. 

There are also some modules already deprecated in Gtk version 4. This only means that they will not be available when Gtk5 comes out. As Emmanuele Bassi says, one of the GNOME Team,
  "Deprecate API is guaranteed to exist for the entire duration of the same major API series; anything that gets deprecated in GTK4 can only be removed in GTK5."

There are too many classes deprecated since Gtk version 4.10 to name them all in a table. However, in the menu the deprecated classes and structures are made visible by coloring them red.
