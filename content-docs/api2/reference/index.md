# Api 2 distribution references

Here you can select a distribution from the side bar. The distributions have the following uses (according to the developers site of Gnome):
* **Gnome::Gtk4**; The GUI toolkit, containing UI elements, layout managers, data storage types for efficient use in GUI applications, and much more.
* **Gnome::Gdk4**; GDK is the abstraction layer that allows GTK to support multiple windowing systems. GDK provides window system facilities on Wayland, X11, Microsoft Windows, and Apple macOS.
* **Gnome::Gsk4**; GSK is an API for creating a scene graph from drawing operation, called “nodes”, and rendering it using different backends. GSK provides renderers for OpenGL, Vulkan and Cairo.
&nbsp;
* **Gnome::GdkPixbuf**; An image loading library which is used by GTK. For simple loading and display of images, GTK can typically be used on its own. However, gdk-pixbuf does provide useful functionality for operating on images as pixel buffers, such as changing colors or creating composites from multiple images, and saving the result.
* **Gnome::Graphene**; A small library which provides vector and matrix datatypes and operations. Graphene provides optimized implementations using various SIMD instruction sets such as SSE and ARM NEON.
&nbsp;
* **Gnome::Gio**; A modern, easy-to-use VFS API including abstractions for files, drives, volumes, stream IO, as well as network programming and IPC though DBus.
* **Gnome::Glib**; A general-purpose utility library, not specific to graphical user interfaces. GLib provides many useful data types, macros, type conversions, string utilities, file utilities, a main loop abstraction, and so on.
* **Gnome::GObject**; A library that provides a type system, a collection of fundamental types including an object type, and a signal system. 
&nbsp;
* **Gnome::Pango**; A text layout library. It plays an important role in internationalization, has full Unicode support, and supports a range of writing systems. Pango APIs are exposed through GTK and can be used for things like setting text as bold or italic.
&nbsp;
* **Gnome::N**; Low level modules to connect to the native libraries and provide the low level Gnome types.

Ideas for later, if ever, are implementing;
* Gtk3 and Gdk3;
* Atk;
* OpenGL or Vulkan;
