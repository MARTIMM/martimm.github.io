# Api 2 distribution references

Here you can select a distribution from the side bar. The distributions have the following uses (according to the developers site of Gnome):
* **Gnome::Gtk4**; GNOMEâ€™s user interface toolkit, and is a comprehensive resource for creating application user interfaces. It includes a wide range of user interface widgets, as well as providing access to an array of system-level features.
* **Gnome::Gdk4**; The GTK windowing system abstraction.
* **Gnome::Gsk4**; The GTK rendering abstraction.
* **Gnome::GdkPixbuf**; An image loading library which is used by GTK. For simple loading and display of images, GTK can typically be used on its own. However, gdk-pixbuf does provide useful functionality for operating on images as pixel buffers, such as changing colors or creating composites from multiple images, and saving the result.
* **Gnome::Graphene**
* **Gnome::Gio**; GObject Interfaces and Objects, Networking, IPC, and I/O.
* **Gnome::Glib**, **Gnome::GObject**;	The base type system library.
* **Gnome::Pango**; A text layout library. It plays an important role in internationalization, has full Unicode support, and supports a range of writing systems. Pango APIs are exposed through GTK and can be used for things like setting text as bold or italic.

* **Gnome::N**; Low level modules to connect to the native libraries and provide the low level Gnome types.
