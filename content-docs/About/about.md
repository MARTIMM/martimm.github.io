# Something about me

Hi, I am Marcel Timmerman and I have been programming with the **Perl** language for quite some time. Besides other languages such as **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **C**, **C++**, ... etc. this language had always a strong pull. On my work I used it on many occasions to find things out on the network, cleaning things up, work on databases and many other large and small projects. This could be done only because of those modules like **Moose**, **Rose::DB**, **Log4perl** and many more.

In the mean time I've left my job and got the opportunity to learn a bit more about the language. I came to the conclusion that **Perl** was changing more than I thought. This is, I think, much more so than in other languages and, very important, without breaking old code!

However, since December 2014 I took up studying **Perl 6** (in the mean time renamed to **Raku**). Now I'm hooked. It is a very nice and rich language capable of many things without using basic modules. You can imagine what it will be capable of when there are as many modules as there are on CPAN for **Perl**.

I am working mainly with **Rakudo** downloaded directly from github and the **MoarVM** virtual machine. Although I am still learning the language, I've taken on maintaining two modules from **Pawe≈Ç Pabian**. These are **MongoDB** and **BSON**. Besides that I am already full of ideas like making a meta information library about all files, projects and media I have scattered around on disk and computers using these modules.

2020-07-07: A lot has changed. Modules have entered the ecosystem and also on **CPAN**, and the **FEZ** ecosystem. **Raku** is becomming much faster and many bugs are removed. The list of projecs of mine is growing too. I need some prioritization to keep an eye on projects without them dying on me. You can read all about it on the projects page.

2023-06-01: Started the **Gnome::Gtk4** project as a follow up on **Gnome::Gtk3**. Setup and generation is made different as well as its use. You can read about it else where on this site.

2024-07-01: the mongdb package has grown and became quite complex. I am trying to follow the [specifications](https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source) from mongodb but squizing it in has proven difficult.
