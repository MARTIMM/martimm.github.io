# Projects

Here is a small list of projects I started or want to start or already working on

# Github pages
  * MARTIMM.github.io project. You are now looking at it! ðŸ˜‰. This is not a Raku project but an attempt to make a central documentation starting point based on github pages facility using the Ruby Jekyll tool.

# MongoDB
  * MongoDB driver project. This project is about a set of modules which help making contact with a `mongod` or `mongos` server and store and retrieve data from a server. The modules needs extending and also maintenance.

    There are other modules needed and were developed for the mongodb driver project.
    * **Auth::SCRAM**. For authentication.
    * **BSON**. To get data in and out of mongodb.
    * **PKCS5**. Needed for authentication.
    * **UEncoding**. Needed for credentials.
    * **Unicode::PRECIS**. Needed for credentials.

  * Library project. A project based on mongodb to keep meta information on anything found on disk. Not much work done at the moment.

# Gnome project :api<1>.
  * Gtk version 3 native binding project. It is about building graphical user interfaces to make attractive applications. To use them properly each import must have the `:api<1>` tagged to it. This has become necessary because of the introduction of Gtk4 (see below) and the rewrite of the depending modules.

    Important to know that this project will not be continued except for minor fixes of course. If needed the :api<2> project will be extended with **Gnome::Gtk3** and **Gnome::Gdk3**.

    * **Gnome::Cairo**. Can be used standalone. If you only need this to create pictures, you can perhaps better use **Cairo** of Timo.
    * **Gnome::Gdk3**. Device access.
    * **Gnome::Gio**. I/O to files, network and dbus etc. Partly implemented because Raku has proper I/O to files and network.
    * **Gnome::Glib**. Basic facilities.
    * **Gnome::Gobject**. Basic object facilities.
    * **Gnome::Gtk3**. Top modules which are most used. Not completely done but a lot is possible.
    * **Gnome::N**. Lowest set of modules to support rest of the Gnome packages.
    * **Gnome::T**. Tools for gui testing. Not yet published.

# Gnome project :api<2>.
  * Gtk version 4 native binding project. It is the natural follow up of **Gnome::Gtk3**. Many distibutions have kept the same name. To use them properly each import must have the `:api<2>` tagged to it.

    * **Gnome::Cairo**. Is not supported anymore. I have made tests where the cairo object is used from the [Cairo](https://raku.land/github:timo/Cairo) distribution of Timo and it works well.
    * **Gnome::Gdk4**. Device access.
    * **Gnome::Gio**. I/O to files, network and dbus etc. Partly implemented because Raku has proper I/O to files and network.
    * **Gnome::Glib**. Basic facilities. Only partly implemented.
    * **Gnome::Gobject**. Basic object facilities. Only partly implemented.
    * **Gnome::Graphene**.
    * **Gnome::Gsk4**.
    * **Gnome::Gtk4**. Top modules which are most used. Not completely done but a lot is possible.
    * **Gnome::N**. Lowest set of modules to support rest of the Gnome packages.
    * **Gnome::Pango**. Text and font manipulations. Only parts will be implemented.

# Smaller projects
  * **Config::DataLang::Refine**. A small project which helps you seeing your hash data in a different way.

  * **Pod::Render**. A way to generate doc in Html, Markdown or Pdf format.
  * **Semaphore::ReadersWriters**. A module to protect variables using Semaphores. Access from different threads must be controlled, otherwise unpredictable results can happen or even untraceble crashes.
  * **Tinky::Hash**. Build on **Tinky** of JStowe.
  * **Xml::Actions**. A small project which helps you running through an XML file.

  * **GnomeTools**. A library of tools and widgets based on the :api<2> Gnome libraries.

# Programs
  * PuzzleTable. Not yet published.
  * SessionManager. Not yet published.
