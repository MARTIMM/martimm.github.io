* 2025-12-17 1.0.0
  * Let's say that it is version 1. The site already exists for some time and now I'll keep up the changes happening.
  * Change of theme. I used tactile and rouge based on Jackyll but saw another one which looked promising. It is called Minimal Mistakes. The reason is that I wanted to start writing short stories about the projects. Much is already done in tutorials but had a need to catagorize them and reachable from other locations. They also should look different from the reference pages. The new theme comes with a lot of `_includes` and `_layouts` which made me thinking of adding a few of myself to separate more parts of the display of data. With the new theme, the old layout collapses and changes must be made in several files to get that right again.
