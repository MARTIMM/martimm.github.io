<p>Santa Claus is a tough man, I know that for sure! The other day, he came rushing in, pale around the nose. He said there was a huge shortage of advent papers, 'that we need to write several documents and quick! thank you very much!'.</p><p>Luckely the departement was just on the verge of writing a piece we were working on. It is all about the Raku language binding to the native libraries of Gnome. It has been done before, examples are <strong>GTK::Scintilla</strong> and <strong>GTK::Simpler</strong> of azawi, <strong>GTK::Simple</strong> of Richard Hainsworth and <strong>GtkLayerShell</strong> of CIAvash.</p><p>This departement already wrote the <strong>Gnome::Gtk3</strong> repository and its dependencies. The modules found in there are all generated from the C source files. However, there was a growing concern that the generator became too complex to handle all kind of differences showing up in the C source code, and the idea to get a binding for Gtk version 4 made it even impossible. Also, the installation of the packages took a long time so other paths were investigated.</p>
